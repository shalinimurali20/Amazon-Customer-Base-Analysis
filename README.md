# Amazon-Customer-Base-Analysis

In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce, the ability to strategically leverage consumer data offers a significant competitive advantage. Drawing upon the skills I've honed in strategic thinking courses, along with my practical experiences from the "Business in Practice" module during my Master's program, I aim to delve deeply into the behavioral patterns and preferences of online shoppers.

By examining various facets of consumer behavior, from the effectiveness of personalized recommendations to the influence of customer reviews on purchase decisions, this analysis seeks to uncover actionable insights that can refine customer experiences, enhance engagement, and drive business growth. Each segment of this investigation is designed not only to interpret data but also to implement strategic measures that align with contemporary business practices and technological advancements in the digital marketplace.

## Part 1: Customer Behavior and Segmentation based on Purchase and Browsing Patterns

### Findings
1. Female puchasing and browsing pattern is higher than others.
2. Age range between 29-32 are the most frequent purchasers and browsers.
3. Negligible correlation between purchase frequency and browsing frequency showing no strong relationship between the both.

### Segmentation Insights
### Segment 1: Extremities
- Purchase Pattern: Less than once a month ~ Few times a week
- Browsing Pattern: Multiple times a day ~ Rarely
- Reasoning/Insights: These customers either purchase/browse a lot or they never turn up. This could reflect customer indecisiveness about their purchase.
- Recommendation: Personalised recommendations, targeted marketing messages suggesting potential customer preferences

### Segment 2: Potential Loyalists
- Purchase Pattern: Once a month ~ Once a week
- Browsing Pattern: Few times a week
- Reasoning/Insights: While the frequency of the customer purchases is moderate, there exists consistent customer interaction as reflected by the browsing pattern. Maybe they are price sensitive or they wait for a particular time period to initiate purchases. Targeting them can convert them to potential loyalists.
- Recommendation: Offering deals and discounts frequently. Membership opportunities providing additional benefits to customers. Offering time bound offers and discounts.

### Segment 3: Casual Customers
- Purchase Pattern: Few times a month
- Browsing Pattern: Few times a month
- Reasoning/Insights: Both purchases and browsing are moderately low.
- Recommendation: Cross selling and upselling startegies can be undertaken to increase their basket rate even if they purchase a few times. Offering time bound offers and discounts.

## Part 2: Effectiveness of Personalized Recommendations:

### Findings
Consider There exists a moderately positive relationship between
- Shopping Satisfaction [Low satisfaction (15%)]
- Recommendation Frequency
However, there exists no evident relationship with Recommendation Helpfulness [Note: It is encoded.] And also a weak association with Service_Appreciation.

Given the low satisfaction among customers with 3 being the highest in each group, Amazon must focus on improving the quality of the same. While there exists a positive relation among the variables, the proportion of customers with higher satisfaction is very less.

While 75% of customers find recommendations helpful or sometimes helpful, the non-existence of relationship with other variables indicate (i.e.) though recommendations are helpful it has negligible effect on customer shopping satisfaction and other attributes.

This can attribute to: **recommendation content, frequency and relevance.**
